# Deep Learning for Flower Image Similarity Assessment

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of deep learning approaches for flower image similarity assessment using the 102 Flower Category Dataset. The project explores different embedding-based architectures and their robustness to adversarial attacks.

## üìö Project Overview

This educational project implements and compares three different deep learning approaches for image similarity assessment:

1. **Center Loss Classification** - Uses classification with center loss to learn discriminative features
2. **Siamese Networks** - Learns similarity through paired comparisons
3. **Triplet Loss Networks** - Optimizes embedding space using triplet margin loss

Each approach is evaluated for both standard performance and adversarial robustness, providing insights into different architectural choices for similarity learning tasks.
